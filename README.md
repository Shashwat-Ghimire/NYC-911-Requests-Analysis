NYC 911 Requests Analysis
ðŸŒŸ Project SummaryThis project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the NYC 911 Service Requests dataset, comprising over 300,000 entries and 53 attributes. The dataset captures details of public service requests reported to various city agencies, including location, request type, timestamps, and resolution status.
The analysis was performed using Python in Jupyter Lab, employing data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization techniques to uncover key insights into city operations and request patterns.
ðŸŽ¯ Goals  

Clean the dataset by addressing missing values, correcting data types, and removing unnecessary columns.  
Investigate request distribution by type, agency, and borough.  
Examine response and resolution durations.  
Generate visualizations to highlight trends and patterns in service requests.  
Prepare the dataset for potential predictive modeling or advanced analytics.
